 RFM analysis project
**RFM Analysis in Retail Data**

Introduction

RFM stands for “Recency, Frequency, Monetary” and is a way to figure out who your most valuable customers are. Recency is how recently a customer has transacted with a brand, Frequency is how frequently they’ve engaged with a brand, and Monetary is how much money they’ve spent on a brand’s products and services. In this project, we will analyze retail data to find out 'RFM' and finally find out which one is the valuable customer, so that we can treat them differently. 

Purposes:

1. Find out how many 'low value customer', 'high value customer', dan 'normal value customer'

Phases:
1. Data Overview
2. Pre-processing Data
3. RFM analysis

conclusion:
1. the number of high value customer is 1133 customer, normal customer is 2137 and low value customer is 1102 customer.
2. each and every label of customer should be treated differently
